#  Pricing & Snapshot Dashboard (Capstone Project)

This repository presents part of the **Capstone Project for the MSc Business Analytics at the University of Birmingham**.
The project was delivered for a **Media Agency** client. To protect confidentiality, the client’s real name and identifying details have been removed. All datasets provided here are synthetic and only mimic the structure of the original data.

##  Project Overview

* **Objective:** Design dashboards in Power BI to support pricing decisions and monthly commercial performance reviews.
* **Scope:** Development of a **Snapshot dashboard** (Year-to-Date KPIs, service mix, client concentration) and a **Pricing dashboard** (dynamic cost allocation, labour markups, blended rate guardrails).
* **Tools & Languages:** Power BI (DAX, Power Query M), R (clustering & complexity analysis).

---

##  Methodology

* **Data Preparation:**

  * Reconciled timesheet and payrate data to reconstruct project-level costs.
  * Removed duplicates and invalid project IDs.
  * All transformations documented in Power BI (M code).

* **Snapshot Dashboard:**

  * Tracks revenue, cost, gross profit, and margin across months.
  * Highlights service mix, project demand, and client revenue distribution.
  * Identifies client concentration risks.

* **Pricing Model & Dashboard:**

  * **Fixed Cost Allocation (DAR):** Distributes overheads systematically by service demand.
  * **Labour Markups:** Combines *complexity* (from R k-means clustering) and *urgency* (based on workload vs deadline).
  * **Blended Rate Adjustment (BRA):** Ensures quoted rates stay within market benchmark bounds (£75–£105/hr).
  * Implemented fully in **DAX**, with results audited for transparency.
